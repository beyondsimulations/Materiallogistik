# Materiallogistik

This repository contains teaching materials for the course "Materiallogistik" at the University of Duisburg-Essen for the Summer Semester 2025. I have taken over this course on short notice and have only slightly adapted the materials. The content is based on the original lecture by Prof. Dr. Manitz, with no new content added but new exercises included.

## Course Description

This course covers the Materials Logistics module based on the original lecture materials from Prof. Dr. Manitz. The goal is to prepare students for exams while introducing them to the fundamentals of materials logistics.

## Course Modules

The core content of the course is divided into six modules:

1. **Klassifikation** - Classification of materials
2. **Einstufige Losgrößen** - Lot sizing planning with CLSP
3. **Mehrstufige Losgrößen** - Lot sizing planning based on PLSP
4. **Bestandsmanagement** - Service levels and delivery times
5. **Bestellpolitiken** - Newsvendor problem and ordering policies
6. **Recap** - Review and open questions

## Tutorials

The tutorials have been created by me based on Prof. Dr. Manitz's lecture. They help students apply and understand the concepts from the lecture. The final exam is oriented towards Prof. Manitz's practice exams and will cover the topics we have covered together in the lecture.
